"""
Continuous monitoring — scheduled scans, alert only on change.

This module is deliberately thin. It owns *when* to scan and *whether* to
alert; it owns none of the scanning. The scan, the diff and the snapshot are
the exact same code an interactive scan runs (main.run_scan_once, which drains
main.scan_events). Forking that pipeline would mean two definitions of "a scan"
drifting apart, and the monitor quietly reporting something the dashboard never
would.

Everything it does need — the scan runner, the notifier, the single-link
recheck, the snapshot readers — is injected. So the alerting rules below are
tested without a database, a browser or a network, and the rules are what break
if someone loosens them.

Three disciplines, stated once:

  SILENT BY DEFAULT   nothing changed  -> no alert, ever.
  NEVER ALERT ON DOUBT  a finding in `unverifiable` — bot-blocked, timed out —
                        does not wake anyone at 3am. Only provable broken /
                        dead_cta transitions do.
  NEVER ALERT ON A BLIP a new break is re-checked once before it alerts. A link
                        that passes the recheck was a transient failure and is
                        dropped.
