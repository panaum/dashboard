"""
Passive form audit.

A broken form is invisible. The page looks perfect, the visitor types their
details, presses send — and the lead evaporates. Nothing 500s, nothing logs.
For a lead-gen client this is the single most expensive defect on the site.

THIS MODULE NEVER SUBMITS A FORM. It reads the DOM and checks the action URL
with an ordinary GET, through the checker every other link goes through. There
is no .submit(), no POST, no synthetic event, and no code path that fills a
field. Submitting would spam the client's CRM and their sales team's phones,
which is worse than the bug we are looking for.

Verdicts land in the existing buckets. The governing rule is stricter here than
for links: **when we cannot PROVE a form is broken, it is `unverifiable`.**
Telling a client their contact form is dead when it works costs more trust than
staying quiet.

# What a GET to a form's action actually tells you.
#
# Almost nothing, most of the time. Verified against real endpoints:
#   EmailOctopus  -> 405
#   HubSpot forms -> 405
#   Formspree     -> 405
# They accept POST and nothing else. A 405/403 is the SIGN OF A HEALTHY FORM
# endpoint, not a broken one. Treating "not 200" as a problem would flag almost
# every form on the internet.
#
# And the checker maps 5xx to bucket "broken", so a POST-only endpoint that 500s
# on a GET would be reported as "submissions may be lost" — claiming a working
# form is dead. Only a status that proves the destination is GONE may do that.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ─── THE RULE THAT KEPT BEING BROKEN ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The form POSTs. We ask with GET. The endpoint answers about GET. Any claim we
# then make about POST is an inference, not an observation.
#
# That single mistake shipped three times, each time as a different status code,
# each time fixed by special-casing that one code — which guarantees a fourth:
#
#   405  every real endpoint returns it (EmailOctopus, HubSpot, Formspree)
#   500  a POST-only endpoint may 500 on a GET
#   404  Next.js/Django/Rails serve their 404 page for the wrong method
#        (fautons.com/api/auth/request: GET 404, OPTIONS 405, POST signs you in)
#
# The list of statuses that mean "alive, but not for GET" cannot be enumerated:
# it depends on the framework. So the rule is inverted. Two things prove a form
# posts nowhere, and nothing else does:
#
#   1. the host does not resolve            — there is no server
#   2. 410 Gone                             — the server says so, unambiguously
#
# Everything else is at most `unverifiable`. This is enforced by a property test
# over every status 100–599: see test_no_status_code_can_prove_a_form_is_broken.
# If you are about to add a status here, that test will stop you. It is meant to.
